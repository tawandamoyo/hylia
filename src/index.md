Hi, I'm Tawanda. I like programming and contributing to Open Source. Areas I'm interested in include all things JavaScript, Linux, Browsers, Web Perfomance and Open Access

For more about what I'm doing now, check out my [now page](https://tawanda.dev/now).

I'm also on Twitter as [@tbmoyo](https://twitter.com/tbmoyo).
