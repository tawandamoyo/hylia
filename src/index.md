I like programming and contributing to Open Source. Areas I'm interested in include Linux, Browsers, Web Perfomance, Online Education and Open Access to the Internet and all things JavaScript.

For more about what I'm doing now, check out my [now page](https://tawanda.dev/now).

I'm also on Twitter as [@tbmoyo](https://twitter.com/tbmoyo).
