Hi, I'm Tawanda and welcome to my website.

I am a programmer living in Zimbabwe. I like all things to do with JavaScript and love Open Source. I'm always looking for ways to contribute to Open Source Software.

Outside programming I like reading (esp fantasy novels), blogging and football.

My favorite books include _Meditations_, _Deep Work_, _Antifragile_ and _A Song of Ice and Fire_ Series.

I'm on Twitter as [@tbmoyo](https://twitter.com/tbmoyo) and you can also email me at **moyotawanda** [at] **gmail.com**
